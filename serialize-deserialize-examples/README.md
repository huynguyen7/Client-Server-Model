# TRANSFERING OBJECTS THROUGH SOCKETS:
This example explains how to transfer objects through sockets:
- In order to do homework, _'client'_ (student) will send request by typing 'start' to the input command line. The _'server'_ (school) will receive the request and response with a random generated homework. The student then will need to finish the homework and send it back to the school to get grades.

**NOTES:**
This implementation is written to used for 'localhost' only.
